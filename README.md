# Concurrent Systems Labs

### What the hell is this?
Some multi threaded programs written in C using posix threads. Threads aren't reliable. I have learned this. This repo merely holds all the sources for the labs with fan favourites such as [concurrent pi](https://github.com/22a/ConSys/tree/master/lab1) and [producer/consumer simulation](https://github.com/22a/ConSys/tree/master/lab2)!


### Why is this on github?
* To save me time scp'ing to remote test servers with hella cores.
* Because I can.
